## 📦 Libraries Used

This project relies on the following Python libraries:

| Library        | Purpose |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `cryptography` | RSA key generation, AES-GCM encryption, OAEP padding |
| `os`, `sys`    | File system access and process control |
| `json`         | Simulator state persistence |
| `shutil`       | Secure file backup operations |

All external dependencies are listed in **`requirements.txt`** and should be installed inside a virtual environment.
