📌 **Why this matters**
- “Usage examples” is a **hard requirement** in many READMEs
- Shows you understand **user interaction**, not just code

## 📦 Dependencies & Libraries Used

This project relies on the following Python libraries:

| Library | Purpose |
|-------|--------|
| `cryptography` | RSA key generation, AES-GCM encryption, OAEP padding |
| `os`, `sys` | File system access and process control |
| `json` | Simulator state persistence |
| `shutil` | Secure file backup operations |

All external dependencies are listed in **`requirements.txt`** and should be installed inside a virtual environment.
